# mlbc: Media Labeller for Binary Classification

mlbc is a tool designed to efficiently label media (images or audio) for the purpose of binary classification in machine learning projects.

# Build (macOS)
 - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
 - Open the terminal app and run the following commands from the project root directory.
    - `$ ./configure.sh` ('$' is not part of the command. It represents your terminal prompt). You only need to run this command once even if you build multiple times.
    - `./build.sh`. This will build the project executable. You can find it under `your-project-root/build` directory.
